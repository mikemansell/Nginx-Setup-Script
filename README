I wrote this script to download, build, and use the popular Nginx HTTPd as well as the
basic dependancies that it needs in order to run.  When I was hosting a website on my
personal VPS, I simply ran Nginx as my Linux user (using port 8080 and using IPTables to
redirect port 80 to 8080), however you could just as easily run the HTTPd as an isolated
web user given you're willing to spend a few minuts in order to set up permissions.

To set up, create a directory where you want to house the HTTPd.  Then move (cd) into said
directory, move the script into it, edit the script for the "PREFIX" value, chmod +x
the script, and run `./script build all`

Because it downloads and compiles everything that it needs, it's going to take a few
minutes (~20m on a decent VPS) to set up.  Be patient.

The script also accepts paramaters for "start", "stop", and "rehash", which controls both
the HTTPd and spawn-fcgi for PHP, as well as MariaDB.

While I started this as a simple script for *just* Nginx, I quickly gave into adding PHP
and MariaDB (MySQL replacement) support to create a fully functional "LAMP" replacement.
