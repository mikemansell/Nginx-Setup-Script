I wrote this script to download, build, and use the popular Nginx HTTPd as well as the
basic dependancies that it needs in order to run.  When I was hosting a website on my
personal VPS, I simply ran Nginx as my Linux user (using port 8080 and using IPTables to
redirect port 80 to 8080), however you could just as easily run the HTTPd as an isolated
web user given you're willing to spend a few minuts in order to set up permissions.

While I started this as a simple script for *just* Nginx, I quickly gave into adding PHP
and MariaDB (MySQL replacement) support to create a fully functional "LAMP" replacement.

So, you want to install it, eh?  The setup process is pretty simple (after all, that's the
purpose of the script).  You *should* be able to get the just of everything by poking around
the nginx.sh file, but for those of you that want to get going right away, here's how I
personally use this script on my own installations.

      - Install "build-essential" (if you're a Debain user) or the equivelant package for
        your distro.

      - Make a folder for the HTTPd;
        `mkdir $HOME/httpd`

      - Move into your newly created folder;
        `cd $HOME/httpd`

      - Download this script;
        `wget -O nginx https://raw.github.com/mikemansell/Nginx-Setup-Script/master/nginx.sh`

      - Edit the script, changing the "PREFIX" value (defaulted to "$HOME/httpd") to the proper
        folder for your setup.  I use nano as my terminal-based text editor, so `nano nginx`
        works perfect for me.

      - Make the script executable;
        `chmod +x ./nginx`

      - Start the build process;
        `./nginx build all`

      - Replace the included configuration files with sane ones;
        `./nginx setupconfig`

      - Poke around the config directory change things as needed

      - Start the HTTPd, PHP daemon, and MariaDB
        `./nginx start`
